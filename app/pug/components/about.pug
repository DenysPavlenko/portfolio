            p Here men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the Moon. July 1969 AD. We came in peace for all mankind. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next 10. To be the first to enter the cosmos, to engage, single-handed, in an unprecedented duel with natureâ€”could one dream of anything more?<br/><br/> The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow.<br/><br/> Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.
